**RetailStock**
_Implement stock level check for products sold by a retailer._
 
**Problem Description**
Implement a system to check the stock levels for the products sold by a retailer and apply a number of ‘rules’ before returning advice for which products should be ordered.
We should attempt use Spring Boot.
The input/output can be via any medium (Database, FileSystem, HttpRequest/HttpResponse)
The rules to be applied can be stored however you think is most appropriate.
Optional: In addition to returning the output of the stock-check, the results should be persisted to a database to maintain an audit of the stock-check and recommended purchase history.
Rules
There should be a rule allowing specification of a minimum stock level for a product.
There should be a rule allowing products to be marked as blocked (and, as such, can not be ordered).
It should be possible to add a rule to order an additional volume of a certain product.
 
**Example**
5 products and their stock levels:
a,5
b,8
c,2
d,0
e,1
 
Products a,b,c & e have a minimum stock level of 4.
Product d has a minimum stock level of 8.
Product c is blocked and new stock should not be ordered.
Product d has a one-off order of 15.
